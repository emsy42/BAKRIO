# BAKRIO - BREAD RECOGNITION SYSTEM
This is a task I had to complete to get a job at a software company. The purpose of the program is to scan a user supplied .txt file and identify any instances of bread.

This program is designed to take a .txt file and recognise the presence of bread.
It can also display information about the recognised bread and an image of the bread.
The list of bread the program can recognise is customisable and can be added to or edited.
There is also a 'fun' section that includes 'Bread Baker' and 'The Pun Machine'.

The application is programmed in VB.NET using Microsoft Visual Studio. It is only designed to run on Windows operating systems.
